Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with integrating a database into a web application. All user input is stored and saved, ensuring that data persists across sessions when the website is revisited.

Home Page: This is the website's main page, providing a brief overview of its functionality and displaying an image of the accommodation building.

Room List: This page shows all available rooms in the accommodation. The list dynamically updates based on changes in the XAMPP database, ensuring it reflects the most current information.

Room Booking: These images show the booking process. Logged-in users can reserve rooms that are marked as available. Once a room is booked, it is flagged as unavailable (displayed in red) and cannot be booked again.
